# Installation guide <br>

Installing is quite easy, all you have to do is copy your sniplet of choice <br>
<br> For Example <br>

```json
{
  "matchAny": true,
  "tabName": "Co-op",
  "messagePrefix": "/cc ",
  "alwaysMatch": false,
  "regexMatchS": [
    "(§r)*(§.Co-op \u003e)+(.*)",
    "(§r)*(§.Co-op \u003e)+(.*)"
  ],
  "regexIgnoreS": []
}
``` 
<br> Navigate to your hychat config folder, usually `.minecraft/config/hychat`, edit `chat.json` and add the newly copied tabs at the bottom of the list just like so <br>

Make sure your [json is formatted correctly](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#) **OR ElSE** your config will **RESET**, I warned you. <br>

And you are done! Enjoy your new tab.
